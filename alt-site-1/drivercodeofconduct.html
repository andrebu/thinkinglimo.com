								<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>As a chauffeur, you provide an important personalized transport service to the public. The way you drive, dress, talk and act, affects the way passengers feel about each trip they take with Drivr. To encourage passengers to keep using Drivr’s services, you must provide great customer service and conduct yourself in a way that makes them comfortable and at ease. If you and all other Drivr chauffeurs act by the Code of Conduct (the Code), the result will be greater customer satisfaction and increased confidence in our company.</p>
<p>The Drivr code of conduct are developed to clearly describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedures for handling a booking</li>
<li>Behavior that customers and Drivr expect from the chauffeur</li>
<li>Unacceptable behavior</li>
<li>Driver rights</li>
</ul>
<p>Drivr requires that all chauffeurs follow the Code. Drivers who behaves in an "unacceptable" manner, will receive correctional warnings or have their contracts terminated. Correctional warnings can either be: caution, fines, prosecution, retraining or removal from any service related to the company. It is important that you read this document very carefully and understand what it means for you as a driver. If you are unsure about any part of the Code and would like someone to explain it to you in detail, contact Drivr’s operation team on drivrs_uk@drivr.com</p>

</ol>
<h4>How to handle a booking:</h4>
<h4>Accepting bookings:</h4>
<p>Accept all bookings offered to you within the time frame set by DRiVR. If you accept a booking although already being occupied by another customer, this will delay your arrival to the new customer, and essentially get you bad ratings from the customers. A customer will rate you after every ended trip.</p>
<h4>At arrival or approach:</h4>
<p>If you have arrived at the pick-up address and been waiting for a couple of minutes or you are approaching the location and are uncertain you can find the customer, then call the customer. Politely state your status and relevant inquiry to the customer and agree further actions:</p>
<p>Example: "Hi, I’m calling from DRiVR. I’ll be at your destination in 3 minutes, but I’m not entirely sure how to find you there. Can we meet at the west entrance?”"</p>
<p>Example: "Hi, I’m calling from DRiVR. I’m ready for you outside. Please let me know if you are unable to find me. I’m driving a black Mercedes E-Class."</p>
<h4>At pick up address:</h4>
<p>Wait for the customer for 5 minutes. If the customer has not showed up, give him a call and state your status. If the customer doesn’t pick up, wait a couple of minutes and call him/her again.</p>
<p>If it’s a "No Show" trip, call the support phone to register the No Show trip, and press the "No Show" button. The customer will be credit a "No Show" fee to compensate you as a driver.</p>
<h4>Passenger on board:</h4>
<p>Click POB button in app and enter the destination address. It’s important for DRiVR to know your destination address so we can offer you new trips when you are close to the drop off address.</p>
<h4>End of trip:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the customer is a registered DRiVR user, accept the payment directly from your app.</li>
<li>If the customer hasn’t registered their credit card, help them do so by entering in the credit card information on the DRiVR app.</li>
<li>To accept cash payments, call the support center to registered the booking as a cash trip.</li>
<li>Return towards the agreed operating area of DRiVR.</li>
</ul>
